# 260_Project
## Elevator Pitch
For my project I want to re-create a game called bank.\
-The game functions as follows\
    &emsp;&emsp;-Each player rolls two dice on their turn\
    &emsp;&emsp;-Each roll adds to everyones score\
    &emsp;&emsp;-Doubles double the score\
    &emsp;&emsp;-If anyone rolls a 7 the score goes to 0\
    &emsp;&emsp;-At anytime you can bank to save the points, but you can no longer continue to earn points.

## Key Features
&emsp;&emsp;-Login System for highscores\
&emsp;&emsp;-Dice animation\
&emsp;&emsp;-Score tracking and updating\
&emsp;&emsp;-Rule implementations

## Technology Descriptions

&emsp;&emsp;-CSS : support for diffenet screens, animation for different pages, and dice rolling, and score updates.\
&emsp;&emsp;-React : Login, game participants changes, and score updating\
